### Fine-Tuning AI Language Models for Text Generation

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on fine-tuning state-of-the-art AI language models for text generation tasks using various techniques and libraries. The goal is to leverage pre-trained models and adapt them to specific text generation tasks, such as summarization, question answering, or dialogue generation. The project demonstrates how to fine-tune models, optimize training parameters, and generate text outputs for different use cases. Fine-tuning large language models using state-of-the-art techniques like LoRA and bitsandbytes for text generation tasks, enabling the models to produce coherent and contextually relevant text responses based on given prompts or instructions.

**Fine-Tuning 1:**

This Fine-Tuning model demonstrates fine-tuning a language model using the GemmaCausalLM from KerasNLP. It involves downloading a dataset, preprocessing it, configuring the model, compiling it with appropriate settings, and finally training the model with the dataset.

**Fine-Tuning 2:**

In this model, the project utilizes the accelerate library along with other libraries like peft, bitsandbytes, transformers, and trl for fine-tuning a language model. It demonstrates setting up the training arguments, loading the dataset, tokenizer, and model, and then training the model using SFTTrainer.

**Fine-Tuning 3:**

This model focuses on fine-tuning a language model using the Gemma model from Hugging Face and Google's GemmaTokenizer. It involves setting up the environment, loading the dataset, tokenizer, and model, training the model with a custom training loop, and generating text outputs.

**Top 5 Skills/Tools Used:**

1. **Transformers Library (Hugging Face):** Utilized for loading pre-trained language models, tokenization, fine-tuning, and text generation tasks.

2. **Accelerate Library:** Used for distributed training, mixed precision training, and optimizing training performance.

3. **PEFT (Per-layer Energy-based Fine-Tuning):** Employed for fine-tuning language models with custom configurations and optimization strategies.

4. **BitsAndBytes Library:** Used for quantization and optimizing memory and computational resources during training and inference.

5. **TRL (Text Representation Learning):** Utilized for training language models with task-specific objectives, such as text generation or classification, to improve model performance and adaptation to specific tasks.

**Conclusion:**

The project showcases the process of fine-tuning AI language models for text generation tasks using various tools and techniques. By leveraging pre-trained models and customizing them for specific tasks and datasets, the project aims to improve the quality and efficiency of text generation applications.
